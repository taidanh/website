    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Tai Danh, a Computer Science graduate from the University of California Santa Cruz.
      In my current role, I've had the privilege to lead projects, work directly with clients, and
      contribute to meaningful technological advances. My professional journey has been an exciting
      mix of education, innovation, and hands-on experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Growing up in the San Joaquin Valley, I've always been the curious tinkerer. From early days
      fixing laptop viruses to building computers for friends, technology fascinated me. My passion
      for computer science solidified when I took the AP computer science course at another high
      school. This pivotal experience drove me to further my knowledge at UCSC. During my time
      there, not only did I delve into courses that shaped my understanding of the domain, but I
      also led development initiatives using technologies like Laravel and Vue.js. My research at
      the Center for Research in Storage Systems further exposed me to the intricacies of system
      optimization.

    <p>
      Outside of traditional work and academia, I've been involved in several noteworthy projects.
      Rex, a project I collaborated on, stands out as a tool designed to make regular expressions
      modular and intuitive. My work on the C Simple Compiler and Decoder showcases the breadth and
      depth of my skills in both design and implementation. My toolset ranges from Rust and Python
      to C and even MIPS Assembly. These tools, combined with my experience with various Linux
      environments like Ubuntu and Arch, enable me to approach problems with a diverse perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, my life isn't just about code. I'm a strong advocate for open-source software.
      Platforms like NeoVim, Signal, and Bitwarden resonate with me, emphasizing the importance of
      transparency in today's digital age. But my interests stretch beyond the digital realm.
      Culinary arts have always intrigued me, stemming from my parents' restaurant and the countless
      hours I spent watching my father cook. Photography, too, is a passion. From winning a film
      festival with a poignant documentary about the drought to delving into street photography, the
      lens offers me a unique perspective of the world. And for a break from all things digital,
      there's nothing like the thrill of skateboarding or biking through San Francisco's streets.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I look to the future, I'm enthusiastic about furthering my contributions to the tech
      industry. Whether it's a new collaboration, an engaging discussion, or exploring new
      opportunities, I'm always eager to connect. Feel free to explore my GitHub projects or reach
      out on LinkedIn.
